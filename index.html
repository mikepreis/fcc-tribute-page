          <h2>Early Years</h2>
          <p>
            Barkley was born in the Bronx, New York. He grew up a New York Jets fan idolizing running back Curtis Martin. Athleticism ran in the Barkley family. Barkley's father, Alibay, was a talented boxer, his brother, Alibay Jr., was a star baseball player at George Washington High School in New York City who went on to get drafted by the Los Angeles Angels, and his uncle, Iran Barkley, was a professional boxer. Barkley and his family moved to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in search of a safer and more suburban environment in his youth. Barkley attended Whitehall High School in Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania, which competes in the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference.

            At Whitehall, Barkley rushed for 3,646 yards with 63 touchdowns from his sophomore to senior year, including 1,856 yards and 31 touchdowns as a senior.[4] Barkley was rated as a four-star recruit and committed to Penn State University to play college football. He originally committed to Rutgers before changing to Penn State.

            Apart from football, Barkley also lettered in basketball and track and field at Whitehall. As a senior in 2015, he won gold medals in the 100-meter dash (11.15 seconds) at the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference championships and the long jump (22'2.5" or 6.77m) at the District 11 meet, where he also earned a second-place finish in the 100-meter dash with a time of 10.90 seconds which set the school's record.[8] Later in the season, Barkley set personal-best marks of 46'2.5" (14.08m) in the shot put and 6'0" (1.83m) in the high jump.

            <h3>Sophmore Year</h3>
            <p>
              In the first game of his sophomore campaign, Barkley rushed for 105 yards and a touchdown in a 33–13 win over Kent State. In week two, in a renewed rivalry game against Pitt, Penn State trailed at one point in the second quarter 28–7. Barkley scored five touchdowns, his fifth coming with 5:00 left in the fourth quarter, to bring the Nittany Lions within three points. However, quarterback Trace McSorley threw an interception in the Pitt end zone with 1:41 left, that denied the Nittany Lions' hopes of completing the comeback. In week five against Minnesota, in what would become a recurring theme for the 2016 Penn State football team, Penn State had to come back from another halftime deficit. In overtime, on Penn State's first play, Barkley ended the game with a 25-yard touchdown run. Before that carry, Minnesota had held him to only 38 yards on 19 carries. In week six against Maryland, Barkley had his first ever 200-yard rushing game in college. He finished with 31 carries for 202 yards and one touchdown. In week seven, in a matchup versus Ohio State, Barkley rushed for 99 yards on 12 carries with a long of 37 in a 24–21 win over the no. 2 Buckeyes. In week eight, Barkley and no. 24 Penn State scored a season high 62 points versus Purdue. Barkley achieved a career-high 207 rushing yards with a career-high long of 81 yards and two touchdowns, along with 70 yards of receiving, giving him a total of 277 yards on the day. Penn State defeated Purdue 62–24 and improved to 6–2 and 4–1 in Big Ten play.

              On November 1, 2016, Barkley was named a semifinalist for the Maxwell Award. On November 5, Barkley rushed for 167 yards and one touchdown versus Iowa. He added 44 yards and another touchdown in the air, for a total of 211 all-purpose yards in the 41–14 win.

              After the regular season, Barkley was named the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year, Ameche–Dayne Running Back of the Year and First Team All-Big Ten.

              On December 3, 2016, Barkley had 19 carries for 83 yards, rushed for one touchdown, and caught another touchdown on a wheel route. His efforts helped Penn State recover from a 28–7 deficit to stun Wisconsin, 38–31, in the 2016 Big Ten Championship Game.

              During the 2017 Rose Bowl, Barkley added 25 carries for 194 yards, at 7.8 yards per carry, as well as a 79-yard touchdown that gave Penn State a 28–27 lead. After trailing 13–0, Penn State scored seven touchdowns on seven consecutive possessions, including four touchdowns on four consecutive offensive plays, including Barkley's 79-yard touchdown. Barkley would score the first, fourth, and seventh touchdowns for Penn State, giving the Nittany Lions a 49–35 lead in the fourth quarter, but ultimately USC won the game, 52–49.

              Barkley set the Penn State record for rushing yards in a season by a freshman (1,076) and by a sophomore (1,496).

            <h3>Junior Year</h3>
              <p>
                In the first game of the season against Akron, Barkley had 14 rushes for 172 yards, two touchdowns, and a long run of 80 yards. He also recorded 54 receiving yards on two catches. For his efforts, Barkley was named co-Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week.

                In the 2017 Big Ten opener, the Nittany Lions visited the Iowa Hawkeyes. In the dramatic 21–19 win, Barkley had a total of 358 all-purpose yards. He also set a program record for most yards in a single game. Barkley finished the game with 211 rushing yards and a touchdown, 94 receiving yards, and 53 kick return yards. For his efforts, Barkley was again named Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week.

                In the first Big Ten home game of his junior campaign against the Indiana Hoosiers, Barkley carried the ball 20 times for only 56 yards, an underwhelming rushing day for him. Despite this, he still had a major impact on the game, returning the opening kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown, adding 51 yards on 4 catches, and even throwing a 16-yard pass to DaeSean Hamilton late in the fourth quarter to cap off a 45–14 win. Barkley became the first player in Big Ten history to score a return and passing touchdown in the same game. For his efforts, Barkley was named Big Ten Special Teams Player of the Week. One month later against #6 Ohio State, Barkley again returned the opening kickoff back 97 yards for a touchdown, but was limited for the rest of the game to 44 yards rushing on 21 carries, 36 of which came on a TD run in the second quarter. In his final collegiate game, Barkley rushed for 137 yards and 2 touchdowns, one of them a 92-yard effort to put Penn State up 28-7 over the #11 Washington Huskies in the 2017 Fiesta Bowl, which Penn State would go on to win 35-28. On December 31, 2017, about 24 hours after the team's Fiesta Bowl victory, Barkley declared his intentions to enter the NFL draft.
